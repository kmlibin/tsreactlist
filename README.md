# Task Site with TypeScript

This is a quick React page to store a basic todo list...you can add todos, edit them, delete them, or mark them as complete. You can also drag and drop the todos from one column to another (i.e, from "Active Tasks" to "Completed Tasks"), or drag and drop in order to rearrange.

The goal was to learn basic TypeScript functionality in a React App.


### Languages / Libraries / Tools

React, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, HTML

React Icons, Google Fonts, React Beautiful Drag and Drop

### Project Highlights

As mentioned, this project was simple and helpful to learn basic functionality of TypeScript in React. There aren't any huge highlights, except the drag and drop functionality is pretty cool. 

    

### What I learned / Challenges

This is my first formal code-along video - I've taken courses and done projects where there are parts (sometimes significant) of code-along, or there are  "answers" to be found nearby, but this was just 100% code-along in order to  learn TS in React. I enjoyed it quite a bit, actually, because I am a visual learner; watching someone go through it just made sense to me and was what I wanted for a TS intro. 

As you may guess, I learned the basics of how to incorporate TypeScript into React. I also really liked the drag and drop library, although I did have to stare at the documentation for awhile and look around for some troubleshooting (there was an issue with react v. 18). I am curious though about how this developer shared state; although there wasn't necessarily prop drilling, I was under the impression that sharing state around SO much between the components might not be the best way to accomplish something like this. I would have thought that using context would be a better, cleaner way to give props access to state.
